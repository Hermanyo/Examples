# Examples

Compiler tools are complex, and sometimes have hidden functionality to extend the basics that we cover in class. We provide 3 examples written in both flex+bison and SableCC to get you started with your assignments:
1. `linenumbers`: Fetching and printing line numbers for tokens and (non-terminal) AST nodes
2. `optional-semicolon`: Adding optional semicolons to end of lines (Go like behaviour)
3. `tokens`: Printing tokens from the lexer

Additionally, we provide heavily commented versions of the TinyLang scanners and parser written in flex+bison
1. `scanner`: flex scanner
2. `scanner+parser`: flex scanner, bison parser
